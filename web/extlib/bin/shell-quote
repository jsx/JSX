=head1 NAME

shell-quote - quote arguments for safe use, unmodified in a shell command

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<shell-quote> [I<switch>]... I<arg>...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<shell-quote> lets you pass arbitrary strings through the shell so that
they won't be changed by the shell.  This lets you process commands or
files with embedded white space or shell globbing characters safely.
Here are a few examples.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item B<ssh preserving args>

When running a remote command with ssh, ssh doesn't preserve the separate
arguments it receives.  It just joins them with spaces and passes them to
C<$SHELL -c>.  This doesn't work as intended:

    ssh host touch 'hi there'		# fails

It creates 2 files, F<hi> and F<there>.  Instead, do this:

    cmd=`shell-quote touch 'hi there'`
    ssh host "$cmd"

This gives you just 1 file, F<hi there>.

=item B<process find output>

It's not ordinarily possible to process an arbitrary list of files
output by B<find> with a shell script.  Anything you put in $IFS to
split up the output could legitimately be in a file's name.  Here's how
you can do it using B<shell-quote>:

    eval set -- `find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 shell-quote --`

=item B<debug shell scripts>

B<shell-quote> is better than B<echo> for debugging shell scripts.

    debug() {
    	[ -z "$debug" ] || shell-quote "debug:" "$@"
    }

With B<echo> you can't tell the difference between C<debug 'foo bar'>
and C<debug foo bar>, but with B<shell-quote> you can.

=item B<save a command for later>

B<shell-quote> can be used to build up a shell command to run later.
Say you want the user to be able to give you switches for a command
you're going to run.  If you don't want the switches to be re-evaluated
by the shell (which is usually a good idea, else there are things the
user can't pass through), you can do something like this:

    user_switches=
    while [ $# != 0 ]
    do
    	case x$1 in
    	    x--pass-through)
	    	[ $# -gt 1 ] || die "need an argument for $1"
	    	user_switches="$user_switches "`shell-quote -- "$2"`
    	    	shift;;
    	    # process other switches
    	esac
    	shift
    done
    # later
    eval "shell-quote some-command $user_switches my args"
