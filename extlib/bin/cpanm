  =head1 NAME
  
  App::cpanminus - get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      cpanm Module
  
  Run C<cpanm -h> or C<perldoc cpanm> for more options.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  cpanminus is a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from
  CPAN and does nothing else.
  
  It's dependency free (can bootstrap itself), requires zero
  configuration, and stands alone. When running, it requires only 10MB
  of RAM.
  
  =head1 INSTALLATION
  
  There are several ways to install cpanminus to your system.
  
  =head2 Package management system
  
  There are Debian packages, RPMs, FreeBSD ports, and packages for other
  operation systems available. If you want to use the package management system,
  search for cpanminus and use the appropriate command to install. This makes it
  easy to install C<cpanm> to your system without thinking about where to
  install, and later upgrade.
  
  =head2 Installing to system perl
  
  You can also use the latest cpanminus to install cpanminus itself:
  
      curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus
  
  This will install C<cpanm> to your bin directory like
  C</usr/local/bin> (unless you configured C<INSTALL_BASE> with
  L<local::lib>), so you probably need the C<--sudo> option.
  
  =head2 Installing to local perl (perlbrew)
  
  If you have perl in your home directory, which is the case if you use
  tools like L<perlbrew>, you don't need the C<--sudo> option, since
  you're most likely to have a write permission to the perl's library
  path. You can just do:
  
      curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
  
  to install the C<cpanm> executable to the perl's bin path, like
  C<~/perl5/perlbrew/bin/cpanm>.
  
  =head2 Downloading the standalone executable
  
  You can also copy the standalone executable to whatever location you'd like.
  
      cd ~/bin
      curl -LO http://xrl.us/cpanm
      chmod +x cpanm
      # edit shebang if you don't have /usr/bin/env
  
  This just works, but be sure to grab the new version manually when you
  upgrade because C<--self-upgrade> might not work for this.

  perl 5.8 or later.

  =head1 QUESTIONS
  
  =head2 Another CPAN installer?
  
  OK, the first motivation was this: the CPAN shell runs out of memory (or swaps
  heavily and gets really slow) on Slicehost/linode's most affordable plan with
  only 256MB RAM. Should I pay more to install perl modules from CPAN? I don't
  think so.
  
  =head2 But why a new client?
  
  First of all, let me be clear that CPAN and CPANPLUS are great tools
  I've used for I<literally> years (you know how many modules I have on
  CPAN, right?). I really respect their efforts of maintaining the most
  important tools in the CPAN toolchain ecosystem.
  
  However, for less experienced users (mostly from outside the Perl community),
  or even really experienced Perl developers who know how to shoot themselves in
  their feet, setting up the CPAN toolchain often feels like yak shaving,
  especially when all they want to do is just install some modules and start
  writing code.
  
  =head2 Zero-conf? How does this module get/parse/update the CPAN index?
  
  It queries the CPAN Meta DB site at L<http://cpanmetadb.plackperl.org/>.
  The site is updated at least every hour to reflect the latest changes
  from fast syncing mirrors. The script then also falls back to query the
  module at L<http://metacpan.org/> using its wonderful API.
  
  Fetched files are unpacked in C<~/.cpanm> and automatically cleaned up
  periodically.  You can configure the location of this with the
  C<PERL_CPANM_HOME> environment variable.
  
  =head2 Where does this install modules to? Do I need root access?
  
  It installs to wherever ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build are
  configured to (via C<PERL_MM_OPT> and C<PERL_MB_OPT>). So if you're
  using local::lib, then it installs to your local perl5
  directory. Otherwise it installs to the site_perl directory that
  belongs to your perl.
  
  cpanminus at a boot time checks whether you have configured
  local::lib, or have the permission to install modules to the site_perl
  directory.  If neither, it automatically sets up local::lib compatible
  installation path in a C<perl5> directory under your home
  directory. To avoid this, run the script as the root user, with
  C<--sudo> option or with C<--local-lib> option.
  
  =head2 cpanminus can't install the module XYZ. Is it a bug?
  
  It is more likely a problem with the distribution itself. cpanminus
  doesn't support or is known to have issues with distributions like as
  follows:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  Tests that require input from STDIN.
  
  =item *
  
  Tests that might fail when C<AUTOMATED_TESTING> is enabled.
  
  =item *
  
  Modules that have invalid numeric values as VERSION (such as C<1.1a>)
  
  =back
  
  These failures can be reported back to the author of the module so
  that they can fix it accordingly, rather than me.
  
  =head2 Does cpanm support the feature XYZ of L<CPAN> and L<CPANPLUS>?
  
  Most likely not. Here are the things that cpanm doesn't do by
  itself. And it's a feature - you got that from the name I<minus>,
  right?
  
  If you need these features, use L<CPAN>, L<CPANPLUS> or the standalone
  tools that are mentioned.

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item (arguments)

Command line arguments can be either a module name, distribution file,
local file path, HTTP URL or git repository URL. Following commands
will all work as you expect.

    cpanm Plack
    cpanm Plack/Request.pm
    cpanm MIYAGAWA/Plack-1.0000.tar.gz
    cpanm /path/to/Plack-1.0000.tar.gz
    cpanm http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/M/MI/MIYAGAWA/Plack-0.9990.tar.gz
    cpanm git://github.com/miyagawa/Plack.git

Additionally, you can use the notation using C<~> and C<@> to specify
version for a given module. C<~> specifies the version requirement in
the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> format, while C<@> pins the exact version, and
is a shortcut for C<~"== VERSION">.

    cpanm Plack~1.0000                 # 1.0000 or later
    cpanm Plack~">= 1.0000, < 2.0000"  # latest of 1.xxxx
    cpanm Plack@0.9990                 # specific version. same as Plack~"== 0.9990"

The version query including specific version or range will be sent to
L<MetaCPAN> to search for previous releases. The query will search for
BackPAN archives by default, unless you specify C<--dev> option, in
which case, archived versions will be filtered out.

For a git repository, you can specify a branch, tag, or commit SHA to
build. The default is C<master>

    cpanm git://github.com/miyagawa/Plack.git@1.0000        # tag
    cpanm git://github.com/miyagawa/Plack.git@devel         # branch

=item -i, --install

Installs the modules. This is a default behavior and this is just a
compatibility option to make it work like L<cpan> or L<cpanp>.

=item --self-upgrade

Upgrades itself. It's just an alias for:

  cpanm App::cpanminus

=item --info

Displays the distribution information in
C<AUTHOR/Dist-Name-ver.tar.gz> format in the standard out.

=item --installdeps

Installs the dependencies of the target distribution but won't build
itself. Handy if you want to try the application from a version
controlled repository such as git.

  cpanm --installdeps .

=item --look

Download and unpack the distribution and then open the directory with
your shell. Handy to poke around the source code or do manual
testing.

=item -h, --help

Displays the help message.

=item -V, --version

Displays the version number.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

You can specify the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT> environment variable.

=over 4

=item -f, --force

Force install modules even when testing failed.

=item -n, --notest

Skip the testing of modules. Use this only when you just want to save
time for installing hundreds of distributions to the same perl and
architecture you've already tested to make sure it builds fine.

Defaults to false, and you can say C<--no-notest> to override when it
is set in the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>.

=item --test-only

Run the tests only, and do not install the specified module or
distributions. Handy if you want to verify the new (or even old)
releases pass its unit tests without installing the module.

Note that if you specify this option with a module or distribution
that has dependencies, these dependencies will be installed if you
don't currently have them.

=item -S, --sudo

Switch to the root user with C<sudo> when installing modules. Use this
if you want to install modules to the system perl include path.

Defaults to false, and you can say C<--no-sudo> to override when it is
set in the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>.

=item -v, --verbose

Makes the output verbose. It also enables the interactive
configuration. (See --interactive)

=item -q, --quiet

Makes the output even more quiet than the default. It doesn't print
anything to the STDERR.

=item -l, --local-lib

Sets the L<local::lib> compatible path to install modules to. You
don't need to set this if you already configure the shell environment
variables using L<local::lib>, but this can be used to override that
as well.

=item -L, --local-lib-contained

Same with C<--local-lib> but when examining the dependencies, it
assumes no non-core modules are installed on the system. It's handy if
you want to bundle application dependencies in one directory so you
can distribute to other machines.

For instance,

  cpanm -L extlib Plack

would install Plack and all of its non-core dependencies into the
directory C<extlib>, which can be loaded from your application with:

  use local::lib '/path/to/extlib';

=item --mirror

Specifies the base URL for the CPAN mirror to use, such as
C<http://cpan.cpantesters.org/> (you can omit the trailing slash). You
can specify multiple mirror URLs by repeating the command line option.

You can use a local directory that has a CPAN mirror structure
(created by tools such as L<OrePAN> or L<Pinto>) by using a special
URL scheme C<file://>. If the given URL begins with `/` (without any
scheme), it is considered as a file scheme as well.

  cpanm --mirror file:///path/to/mirror
  cpanm --mirror ~/minicpan      # Because shell expands ~ to /home/user

Defaults to C<http://search.cpan.org/CPAN> which is a geo location
aware redirector.

=item --mirror-only

Download the mirror's 02packages.details.txt.gz index file instead of
querying the CPAN Meta DB.

Select this option if you are using a local mirror of CPAN, such as
minicpan when you're offline, or your own CPAN index (a.k.a darkpan).

B<Tip:> It might be useful if you name these mirror options with your
shell aliases, like:

  alias minicpanm='cpanm --mirror ~/minicpan --mirror-only'
  alias darkpan='cpanm --mirror http://mycompany.example.com/DPAN --mirror-only'

=item --mirror-index

B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Specifies the file path to C<02packages.details.txt>
for module search index.

=item --prompt

Prompts when a test fails so that you can skip, force install, retry
or look in the shell to see what's going wrong. It also prompts when
one of the dependency failed if you want to proceed the installation.

Defaults to false, and you can say C<--no-prompt> to override if it's
set in the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>.

=item --dev

B<EXPERIMENTAL>: search for a newer developer release as well. Defaults to false.

=item --reinstall

cpanm, when given a module name in the command line (i.e. C<cpanm
Plack>), checks the locally installed version first and skips if it is
already installed. This option makes it skip the check, so:

  cpanm --reinstall Plack

would reinstall L<Plack> even if your locally installed version is
latest, or even newer (which would happen if you install a developer
release from version control repositories).

Defaults to false.

=item --interactive

Makes the configuration (such as C<Makefile.PL> and C<Build.PL>)
interactive, so you can answer questions in the distribution that
requires custom configuration or Task:: distributions.

Defaults to false, and you can say C<--no-interactive> to override
when it's set in the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>.

=item --scandeps

Scans the depencencies of given modules and output the tree in a text
format. (See C<--format> below for more options)

Because this command doesn't actually install any distributions, it
will be useful that by typing:

  cpanm --scandeps Catalyst::Runtime

you can make sure what modules will be installed.

This command takes into account which modules you already have
installed in your system. If you want to see what modules will be
installed against a vanilla perl installation, you might want to
combine it with C<-L> option.

=item --format

Determines what format to display the scanned dependency
tree. Available options are C<tree>, C<json>, C<yaml> and C<dists>.

=over 8

=item tree

Displays the tree in a plain text format. This is the default value.

=item json, yaml

Outputs the tree in a JSON or YAML format. L<JSON> and L<YAML> modules
need to be installed respectively. The output tree is represented as a
recursive tuple of:

  [ distribution, dependencies ]

and the container is an array containing the root elements. Note that
there may be multiple root nodes, since you can give multiple modules
to the C<--scandeps> command.

=item dists

C<dists> is a special output format, where it prints the distribution
filename in the I<depth first order> after the dependency resolution,
like:

  GAAS/MIME-Base64-3.13.tar.gz
  GAAS/URI-1.58.tar.gz
  PETDANCE/HTML-Tagset-3.20.tar.gz
  GAAS/HTML-Parser-3.68.tar.gz
  GAAS/libwww-perl-5.837.tar.gz

which means you can install these distributions in this order without
extra dependencies. When combined with C<-L> option, it will be useful
to replay installations on other machines.

=back

=item --save-dists

Specifies the optional directory path to copy downloaded tarballs in
the CPAN mirror compatible directory structure
i.e. I<authors/id/A/AU/AUTHORS/Foo-Bar-version.tar.gz>

=item --uninst-shadows

Uninstalls the shadow files of the distribution that you're
installing. This eliminates the confusion if you're trying to install
core (dual-life) modules from CPAN against perl 5.10 or older, or
modules that used to be XS-based but switched to pure perl at some
version.

If you run cpanm as root and use C<INSTALL_BASE> or equivalent to
specify custom installation path, you SHOULD disable this option so
you won't accidentally uninstall dual-life modules from the core
include path.

Defaults to true if your perl version is smaller than 5.12, and you
can disable that with C<--no-uninst-shadows>.

B<NOTE>: Since version 1.3000 this flag is turned off by default for
perl newer than 5.12, since with 5.12 @INC contains site_perl directory
I<before> the perl core library path, and uninstalling shadows is not
necessary anymore and does more harm by deleting files from the core
library path.

=item --cascade-search

B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Specifies whether to cascade search when you specify
multiple mirrors and a mirror doesn't have a module or has a lower
version of the module than requested. Defaults to false.

=item --skip-installed

Specifies whether a module given in the command line is skipped if its latest
version is already installed. Defaults to true.

B<NOTE>: The C<PERL5LIB> environment variable have to be correctly set for this
to work with modules installed using L<local::lib>.

=item --skip-satisfied

B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Specifies whether a module (and version) given in the
command line is skipped if it's already installed.

If you run:

  cpanm --skip-satisfied CGI DBI~1.2

cpanm won't install them if you already have CGI (for whatever
versions) or have DBI with version higher than 1.2. It is similar to
C<--skip-installed> but while C<--skip-installed> checks if the
I<latest> version of CPAN is installed, C<--skip-satisfied> checks if
a requested version (or not, which means any version) is installed.

Defaults to false.

=item --verify

Verify the integrity of distribution files retrieved from PAUSE using
CHECKSUMS and SIGNATURES (if found). Defaults to false.

=item --auto-cleanup

Specifies the number of days in which cpanm's work directories
expire. Defaults to 7, which means old work directories will be
cleaned up in one week.

You can set the value to C<0> to make cpan never cleanup those
directories.

=item --man-pages

Generates man pages for executables (man1) and libraries (man3).

Defaults to false (no man pages generated) if
C<-L|--local-lib-contained> option is supplied. Otherwise, defaults to
true, and you can disable it with C<--no-man-pages>.

=item --lwp

Uses L<LWP> module to download stuff over HTTP. Defaults to true, and
you can say C<--no-lwp> to disable using LWP, when you want to upgrade
LWP from CPAN on some broken perl systems.

=item --wget

Uses GNU Wget (if available) to download stuff. Defaults to true, and
you can say C<--no-wget> to disable using Wget (versions of Wget older
than 1.9 don't support the C<--retry-connrefused> option used by cpanm).

=item --curl

Uses cURL (if available) to download stuff. Defaults to true, and
you can say C<--no-curl> to disable using cURL.

Normally with C<--lwp>, C<--wget> and C<--curl> options set to true
(which is the default) cpanm tries L<LWP>, Wget, cURL and L<HTTP::Tiny>
(in that order) and uses the first one available.
